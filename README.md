### 1️⃣ Fingerprint-Based Cryptographic Key Generation Using Deep Learning

🔍 **Description**  
This project focuses on generating **stable cryptographic keys from fingerprint biometrics** using deep learning techniques.  
The goal is to eliminate traditional key storage by deriving cryptographic keys directly from biometric data.

🛠 **Key Concepts**
- CNN-based fingerprint feature extraction
- Deep embedding using MobileNet architecture
- Binary quantization of features
- Fuzzy extractor and error correction
- Secure cryptographic key generation and matching

🧰 **Technologies Used**
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Cryptography libraries
